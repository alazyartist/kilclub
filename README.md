**The Problem:**

Small businesses often struggle to compete with larger corporations when it comes to visibility and online presence. Customers, on the other hand, seek personalized, reliable, and efficient services from local service providers. There's a gap that needs to be filled â€“ an avenue that connects these businesses and customers seamlessly. These businesses also struggle to showcase the work they are doing in their communities to potential new clients.

**The Solution:**

KeepItLocal.club Our website will act as a centralized hub where small businesses can create profiles, showcase their work through before-and-after pictures, and host reviews from satisfied customers. This will not only boost their online presence but also build trust within the community.

### **Collecting Social Proof**

**Business Profiles**: Local businesses can set up detailed profiles, highlighting their services, expertise, and portfolio. This provides customers with a clear understanding of what each business offers.

**Review System**: Customers will receive a link to their phones after availing a service. This link will lead them to a simple review system where they can provide a star rating and write a short review. This real-time feedback mechanism is invaluable for both businesses and potential customers.

**Local Search**: Our intuitive search feature allows users to find businesses based on location and service category. This ensures that users can easily discover the services they need in their immediate vicinity

**Visual Showcase**: We're making use of before-and-after pictures to demonstrate the quality of work. A picture speaks a thousand words, and this feature will help businesses display their skills effectively.
